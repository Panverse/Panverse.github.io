# ðŸ“Œ Additional Notes

* **Rule Updates:** Rules may be updated at any time without prior notice. Members must stay informed by checking regularly. Ignorance will not excuse violations.
* **Punishment Severity:** Sanctions range from warnings to permanent bans, depending on offense type, frequency, and impact. Repeat offenses increase punishment severity.
* **Appeals:** All punishments can be appealed respectfully through official channels. Public drama or disrespect towards staff voids appeal chances.
* **Reporting:** Always report rule violations or staff abuse privately. Malicious or false reports will be punished severely.
* **Confidentiality:** Reports and appeals are confidential to protect involved parties. Retaliation against reporters or staff is prohibited.
* **Community Values:** Panverse strives to maintain a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment. Toxicity, drama, and rule-breaking harm the community and will be addressed firmly.
* **Final Authority:** Server staff have ultimate authority to enforce rules and protect the community. Cooperation during investigations is mandatory.
